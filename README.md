# Intro

Hello,

My name is Anh Le, I am an aspiring Web Developer. I don't profess to be a Designer, though I would like to make a suggestion to your website in place of a standard application for your Web Engineer (Front-End) position.

## suggestion

After you click on an item in your top navigation, you get a dropdown menu. But if you move your mouse away from the navigation, there is no visual indication on which navigation item the dropdown belongs to. Furthermore, the dropdown is a little awkward in that it have the width of the entire page, so it is cover a large portion of the banner.

I would suggests that you change the CSS of the navigation item after it is clicked to indicate that it is "active". Regarding the banner being covered, setting the background opacity will help.
